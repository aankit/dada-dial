#dada-dial

Dada Dial cuts up audio poetry from John Giorno's 1969 Dial-A-Poem project. The audio files from Dial-A-Poem are pulled from [Ubu.com](http://www.ubu.com/sound/dial.html). Currently I am using only five poems, but would love to add the entire Ubu sound catalog.

Dada Dial is available at 917-534-6464, ext. 11. The scripts in this repo are implemented by Asterisk, but you should be able to run them without a server. The numerous file paths aren't terribly clean yet, but I will get that cleaned up soon.
